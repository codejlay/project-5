## Experience from the project:

It was great learning to create a multi-page website with WordPress and also exposure to a CMS. WordPress has some great plugins to help you create faster like contact forms and debugging tools for troubleshooting. 

It was bit challenging starting this project as there are many layers in WordPress. But once I started to get familiar with the file structure, I started to see the benefits that this can bring to a client. The client is able to update their content and images while keeping the website's html and css code safe.
